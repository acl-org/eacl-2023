# STUDENT VOLUNTEER PROGRAM
We seek a limited number of student volunteers for The 17th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL 2023), for both online and in-person versions. In exchange for one full day equivalent of work, students receive free registration to the main conference, workshops and tutorials, and the social events. The work will be divided, probably into two half-day shifts, and the shifts will be scheduled to maximize volunteer access to the conference events. Tasks will include assisting at the registration desk, stuffing delegate packs, <b>helping to maintain social media</b> (mainly Twitter) and providing assistance for conference events including tutorials, the main conference, and workshops, for either online or in-person versions.

# SELECTION CRITERIA
Applicants for the Student Volunteer Program will be evaluated based on the material they submit in their application packages (see below for the submission requirements). Preference will be given to students who are presenting a paper (physically) in the main conference or any of the associated workshops and do not have other means of travel support.

# SUBMISSION PROCEDURE
Applicants for the Student Volunteer Program must be full-time students and should submit the application form <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-8l9En1mzpTwwqFHBlyQIdDBO9IzkowUeG7NDQgEZt6rjTA/viewform" target='_blank'>here</a> where we ask a few questions and <b>a one-page CV</b>.

Students should make travel arrangements, accommodation, and registration independent of the results of their application. All Student Volunteer Award recipients must also register for the conference and declare <b>“I am a Student Volunteer”</b> in the main conference application form since they will all participate in the Student Volunteer Program.

Students will be reimbursed after the conference and upon providing scanned receipts and an accounting of the requested funding (i.e., a business expense report) to the ACL Business Manager, Priscilla Rasmussen. Students will have to provide a valid mailing address to receive the reimbursement checks (preferred method) or their complete banking details to receive a wire reimbursement (only in case they cannot accept checks).
