## Call for Diversity & Inclusion Subsidies

EACL 2023 is providing D&I funds for registration, caregiving, bandwidth and VPN subsidies. The grants are intended for individuals for whom attending the conference would cause a financial burden or create risks to their safety or privacy. Please apply by 27th March 2023 (2 weeks before the early registration deadline) at [https://forms.gle/RqAGjjEjwdvnEqBv7](https://forms.gle/RqAGjjEjwdvnEqBv7).

Informal enquiries can be made to [eacl2023_div_incl@hw.ac.uk](mailto:eacl2023_div_incl@hw.ac.uk).

### Registration subsidies

This is for getting a waiver for EACL registration. If you haven’t already registered for an \*ACL in 2023, you would also need to pay the ACL membership registration fee, e.g. $100 for regular. You can also request for ACL membership if that’s applicable.

Note that if you are applying for a registration fee waiver, it is expected that you DO NOT register for the conference until you hear from us about your D&I subsidy application. That way, you would not have to ask for a reimbursement, since you would not be charged in the first place. We strongly encourage folks to apply for a volunteership program in order to maximize their chances for getting their registration fees waived.

### Travel subsidies and pre-paid accommodation

We have a limited number of pre-paid accommodation available. These are shared double-rooms in the conference hotel. Please list any special requirements in your application form.  We also have a limited budget allocated to support international travel. Please make sure to outline how you will benefit from in-person attendance at this stage of your career.

### Caregiving and accessibility subsidies

We can reimburse caregiving purchases that you need for the conferences. You need to provide receipts for your purchases. These can be babysitting, transportation costs, or other support required for yourself or your dependents, which would ease your participation. If you need any personal or technical assistance to access and navigate the conference due to a disability, we can reimburse you for the cost of it. This holds for example if you need assistance in using the platform for online participation due to a visual impairment. We acknowledge that accessibility needs are highly individual to each participant, so please feel free to reach out to us with any issues you might face in this regard.

### Bandwidth and VPN subsidies

We can reimburse bandwidth or VPN purchases that you need for the conferences. You need to provide receipts for your purchases. Bandwidth subsidies would be for high-speed internet access costs for the duration of the conference only. VPN generally does not cost more than 10 USD per month and could be applied towards participation if you need anonymity to participate completely (for example, for queer folks who might need this for extra security depending on where they live).

### Selection Criteria

Applicants for the subsidy program will be evaluated based on the material they submit in their application packages. Preference will be given to applicants who are presenting a paper in the main conference, the Student Research Workshop, or any of the workshops associated with EACL 2023, and who do not have other means of support. Preferences will be given to residents of under-represented regions and members of marginalized communities (as detailed in the application form).

### Instructions

Applicants for the D&I subsidy Program should fill the application form at: 
[https://forms.gle/RqAGjjEjwdvnEqBv7](https://forms.gle/RqAGjjEjwdvnEqBv7).

**Application deadline:** 27th March 2023 (anywhere on earth) – 2 weeks before the early registration deadline.

**Notification of acceptance:** 3rd April 2023 – 1 week before the early registration deadline

We aim to send all notifications by the deadline above. However, we will start processing the applications as they come and you may be contacted earlier.
