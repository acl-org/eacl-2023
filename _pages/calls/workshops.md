<h1>EACL 2023 </h1>
<h2>Call for Workshops</h2>

The Association for Computational Linguistics invites proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with EACL 2023, ACL 2023, or EMNLP 2023. We solicit proposals in all areas of computational linguistics, broadly conceived to include related disciplines such as linguistics, speech, information retrieval, and multimodal processing.

Information can be found at the [ACL 2023 website](https://2023.aclweb.org/calls/workshops/)
