### Q: I have already finished my paper and want to put it on ArXiv. What is the deadline for doing so?

A: The anonymity period starts on 13 October 2022, the same as the abstract deadline. From this date onwards, the paper may not *appear* on ArXiv, and you may not promote it on social media. If you thus intend to submit to ArXiv, you have to do so in advance of that date. Violations of this policy will result in desk rejection.

### Q: I am aiming to commit my fully reviewed paper to EACL 2023 via ARR. Do I still have to submit an abstract?

A: No, this just holds for direct full paper submissions to EACL 2023.

### Q: Where can I register an abstract and submit my paper?

A: You can submit it here via the Softconf portal: [https://softconf.com/eacl2023/papers/](https://softconf.com/eacl2023/papers/)

### Q: How much can the abstract in the full submitted paper on 20 October change from the registered abstract on 13 October?

A: Minor changes are allowed, but the core content of the abstract should be the same. This is important for paper matching.

### Q: May I change the title of my paper between the abstract and the full paper submission?

A: No – it is important this stays the same for paper matching and handling, so please think about this carefully before you commit your abstract. 

### Q: May I change the paper authors between the abstract and the full paper submission?

A: No – it is important this stays the same so that we can take conflicts of interest into account, so please think about this carefully before you commit your abstract.

### Q: What other information is required when submitting my abstract?

A: We require all authors to update their [Softconf global profile](https://softconf.com/eacl2023/super/scmd.cgi?ucmd=updateProfile) global profiles and fill in their [EACL 2023 profiles](https://softconf.com/eacl2023/papers/user/scmd.cgi?scmd=updateProfile). This is necessary for making paper assignments, handling conflicts of interest, and so forth. We reserve the right to reject without review papers of authors who have not filled in their EACL 2023 profiles. If you are the submitting author, please make sure your co-authors, if any, have also filled in their profiles. 

### Q: Are dual submission to workshops, such as those collocated with NeurIPS or EMNLP, allowed?

A: It does not violate the multiple submissions rules if it is non-archival. But, there is the anonymity period too that starts on 13th October. So, you would need to make sure that the paper from 13th October onwards does not appear on any preprint server or workshop website, isn’t publicised on social media, etc.


### Q: Are cross-submissions to ACL 2023 allowed?

A: Yes. We will allow this since the ACL 2023 submission deadline and the EACL 2023 notification deadline are on the same day, 20 January 2023. Should your paper be accepted to EACL and you still wish to publish it there, you [must notify ACL of withdrawal no later than 31 January 2023](https://2023.aclweb.org/calls/main_conference/). Note also that the deadline for notifying us of withdrawal of your manuscript is 27 January 2023.
