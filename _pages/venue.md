## About Dubrovnik: 
It is known for its rich history and culture, stunning architecture, and picturesque landscapes. The city's Old Town is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and full of historic landmarks and has plenty to keep you busy on your downtime at the conference.  You can just chill by the water, stroll the streets of the old town. Or you can climb the city walls, explore the surrounding nature, and make several day trips to nearby hotspots: Dubrovnik's Lovrijenac Fort; Franciscan Church and Monastery; Rector’s Palace; Cathedrals; Sponza Palace; the Cable Car; Lokrum Island; Elaphiti Islands; or visit the most prominent filming locations for the most known attraction ‘Game of Thrones' mostly for the exteriors of Westeros' capital city, King's Landing. Dubrovnik's Lovrijenac Fort was the set for most of the Red Keep scenes, the West Pier for Blackwater Bay, and the Jesuit Stairs off St. No matter what you chose to do you will see why Dubrovnik is one of the top destinations to travel to.
