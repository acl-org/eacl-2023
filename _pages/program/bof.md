# Welcome to Birds-of-a-Feather Meetups!

At EACL 2023, we are continuing the tradition of conducting birds-of-a-feather (or BoF) sessions to help newbie researchers get in touch with other people working on the same areas. For people who haven’t attended such meetups before, here’s a quick primer!

# What do we hope to accomplish with BoFs? 
<ul>
<li>We want to provide junior researchers/people attending a CL conference for the first time a platform to discuss ideas and issues with other researchers in their areas of interest. This can be a good avenue for junior researchers to get feedback on ongoing ideas, learn about relevant ongoing projects at other groups/universities and develop a broader understanding of their field of interest.</li>

<li>We want to facilitate more exchange of research ideas, and enable collaborative discussions.</li>
</ul>

# How are BoF sessions structured? 
<ul>
<li>All BoF sessions are in-person only</li>
<li>Each meetup will be led by 1-2 experienced researchers in that area.</li>
<li>Anyone who wants to attend can join; prior signup is not needed.</li>
</ul>
