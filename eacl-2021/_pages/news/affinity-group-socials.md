Note that purely scientific events, such as sessions on “machine translation”, will also take place at EACL 2021 in the form of Birds of a Feather sessions. Expressions of interest to organise such events should thus not be made via this call.

Affinity groups hosting socials will decide on the content, timing and length of socials themselves, and will also handle sign-up to these events. EACL 2021 will promote the socials on the conference website, virtual conference platform and social media and, if desired, create virtual conference rooms and promote links for those.

To express interest in organising an affinity group social, please fill in the following form by 24 March: <https://forms.gle/7159FMuW7MbuZSxu5>

Affinity group socials have to abide by ACL’s code of conduct: <https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-code-ethics>

Requests for affinity group socials which are in conflict with the above, or not in line with the goals of an affinity group social, will be rejected.

Enquiries can be made to the EACL 2021 Diversity & Inclusions chairs: [eacl2021diversity@gmail.com](mailto:eacl2021diversity@gmail.com)
