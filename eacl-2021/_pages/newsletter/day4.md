Today is the fourth day of the EACL. Today at 17:00 CEST, there is a second keynote by **Fernanda Ferreira** on [“Putting things in order: Linearization decisions in language production”]({{ "/program/keynotes/#fernanda-ferreira" | relative_url }}). The whole day consists of different papers live QA sessions. At your leisure before or during the conference, scan through the [schedule](https://www.virtual2021.eacl.org/schedule.html), read the papers, and/or watch the videos.
