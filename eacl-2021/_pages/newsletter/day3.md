<h1 class="page__title">Welcome to the Third Day of EACL 2021!</h1>

Today is the third day of the EACL. The main conference starts today with an opening remark at 8:45 CSET, followed by the first Keynote by **Marco Baroni** on [“On the gap between computational and theoretical linguistics”]({{ "/program/keynotes/#marco-baroni" |  relative_url }}).  The whole day consists of different papers live QA sessions. At your leisure before or during the conference, scan through the [schedule](https://www.virtual2021.eacl.org/schedule.html), read the papers, and/or watch the videos. Decide which ones you want to talk to the authors about.  At 17:00 CEST, there is a **panel discussion on “NLP Applications for Crisis Management and Emergency Situation”** moderator by Gretchen McCulloch. Please note that from 18:00 to 22:00 CEST the Gather Town is open to simulate the real conference experience and socialization.  

Multiple D&I and Social Events are also planned for the day; details available [here](https://www.virtual2021.eacl.org/socials.html). Some of these events are:

- [Queer in AI](https://sites.google.com/view/queer-in-ai/eacl-2021)
- [Cultural Journey Around Ukraine](https://www.airbnb.com.ua/experiences/1748674) (costs are covered by the conference)

There will be multiple mentoring and sessions that will be announced on the fly; keep an eye on RocketChat’s [social event channel](https://eacl2021.rocket.chat/channel/social-events). Please see the [Day 1]({{ "/firstday" | relative_url }}) newsletter for tips for maximizing the conference experience, and the EACL’s [code of conduct]({{ "/code" | relative_url }}) is in place.
