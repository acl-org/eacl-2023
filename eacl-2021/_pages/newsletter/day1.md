In order to make the most out of your EACL conference experience, here are some tips:

- At your leisure before or during the conference, scan through the [schedule](https://www.virtual2021.eacl.org/schedule.html), read the papers, and/or watch the videos. Decide which ones you want to talk to the authors about. 
- There are multiple facilities like Add to Favorites, Visualization, Keyword browsing, etc to make paper search more accessible.  
- Pick a calendar link for the ones you want to discuss and if the time works for you, and add it to your calendar.
- Now that chat is open, feel free to ask questions to the authors at any time that's convenient for you.
- During the presentation slot, you select, join the corresponding Zoom session and discuss the work with the authors.
- Make use of [socials & mentoring](https://www.virtual2021.eacl.org/socials.html) throughout the week! These are opportunities to try to recreate some of the "hallway conversations" that happen at an in-person conference.
- Use the [Directory](https://eacl2021.rocket.chat/directory/channels) to find the different RocketChat channels. Some of useful ones are [#general](https://eacl2021.rocket.chat/channel/general), [#helpdesk](https://eacl2021.rocket.chat/channel/helpdesk), [#social-events](https://eacl2021.rocket.chat/channel/social-events), [#announcements](https://eacl2021.rocket.chat/channel/announcements) and [#live](https://eacl2021.rocket.chat/channel/live).
