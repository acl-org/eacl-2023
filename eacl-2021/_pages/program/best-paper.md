The Best Paper Awards recognise outstanding papers at EACL 2021. The best paper awards were selected as follows:

Based on the paper reviews, the opinions of the area chair, and the senior area chair(s), we constructed a short-list of strong papers. The short-list contained papers of diverse topics e.g., on tasks, models, resources, evaluation methodologies, etc. The papers came from most of the conference tracks and were in both short and long papers format.

The short-listed anonymized papers were sent to the [Best Paper Award Committee]({{ "/best-paper/committee" | relative_url }}) for further review. Based on the BPA committee judgments, the top papers were awarded honourable mentions and best papers. Overall we award 2 best papers and 3 honorable mentions, for both the long papers and short papers lists.
