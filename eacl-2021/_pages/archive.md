For the first time, the conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL) will be hosted in Ukraine, in its capital Kyiv, on 19-23 April, 2021.  While we are planning to hold the conference in Kyiv, we will provide suitable online options if need be.<br><br>
As in previous years, the program of the conference will include poster sessions, tutorials, workshops, and demonstrations, in addition to the main conference. As the flagship European conference in the field of computational linguistics, EACL welcomes European and international researchers covering a broad spectrum of research areas that are concerned with computational approaches to natural language.
