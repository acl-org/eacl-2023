<span style="font-weight: bolder;font-size: larger;">EACL2021 Call for Volunteers</span>

Contact Email: [eacl2021.volunteers@gmail.com](mailto:eacl2021.volunteers@gmail.com)<br/>
Contact: **Student Volunteers Chair**<br/> 
Website: <https://2021.eacl.org><br/>
Submission Deadline: **Friday, 12th March 2021**<br/>

## Volunteer/Scholarship Program

We seek student and non-student volunteers for the 16th conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL 2021). In exchange for one full day equivalent of work, students receive free registration to the main conference (including workshops and tutorials) and ACL membership for one year. Non-student volunteers also receive free registration to the main conference (including workshops and tutorials). We encourage undergraduate students as volunteers, as well as PhD and MSc students.

As EACL 2021 will be virtual, volunteer tasks will be different from previous years. We are seeking volunteers to help us in the following tasks. Please note in your application if you have a preference as to which role you are interested in.

- Technical Support develop the virtual conference website (using CSS/JS, Python/Flask, Apache/NGINX, and GitHub CI and Actions); set up the chat and presentation infrastructure; troubleshoot technical issues during the conference
- Helpdesk monitor on-call channels before or during the conference, including incident management
- Programme Support facilitate video presentations and virtual rooms during the conference, including live Q&A sessions and DEI events (birds-of-a-feather, mentoring)
- Sponsor Liaison point of contact to build and support a sponsorâ€™s conference presence
- Executive Support assist the Volunteer Chair to oversee smooth operations

Volunteers are needed during the conference and workshops, as well as up to three weeks prior to the conference and a short time thereafter. Please consider applying if you are available at any time in this window. As we will receive most of the presentations prior to the conference, a large portion of the tasks will be done in advance, maximizing volunteer access to the conference events.

EACL is eager to increase its diversity and is committed to being inclusive of all underrepresented groups in NLP (by ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation). For this reason, it greatly encourages members of these groups to apply. The information that you provide will be processed by the EACL 2021 organisation team for the sole purpose of volunteer selection and for gathering information about Diversity and Inclusion in our community.

## Selection Criteria

Applicants for the Volunteer/scholarship Program will be evaluated based on the material they submit in their application packages. (See below for the submission requirements.)

Preference will be given to applicants who are presenting a paper in the main conference, the Student Research Workshop, or any of the workshops associated with EACL, who do not have other means of support.

## Submission Procedure

Applicants for the Volunteer/scholarship Program should fill the application form at:<br/>
<https://forms.gle/PNkzUQMMx12FtcGB9>

Application deadline: **Friday, 12th March 2021**<br/>
Notification of acceptance: **Friday, 19th March 2021**

We aim to send all notifications by the deadline above. However, we will start processing the applications as they come and you may be contacted earlier than that. We are particularly looking for people to help in the technical support that can start even before Friday, 19th March 2021. If that is your case, please add your availability in the form for *4-6 weeks before* the conference.
