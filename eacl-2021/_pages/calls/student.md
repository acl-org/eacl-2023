<span style="font-weight: bolder;font-size: larger;">EACL 2021 Student Research Workshop Second Call for Papers</span>

View on the web at <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/eaclsrw2021">https://sites.google.com/<wbr>view/<wbr>eaclsrw2021</a>

Main Conference: April 19-23, 2021<br/>
Workshop: April 19-20, 2021

<strong>Paper Submission Deadline: November 27, 2020</strong>

## General Rules for Submission

The EACL 2021 Student Research Workshop (SRW) provides a forum for student researchers who are investigating various areas related to Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. The workshop provides an excellent opportunity for student participants to present their work and receive valuable feedback from the international research community as well as from selected panelists - experienced researchers, specifically assigned according to the topic of their work, who will prepare in-depth comments and questions in advance of the presentation. The workshop's goal is to aid students at multiple stages of their education: including undergraduate, masters, junior, and senior PhD students.

We invite papers in two different categories:

<strong>Thesis Proposals</strong>: This category is appropriate for PhD students who have decided on a thesis topic and wish to get feedback on their proposal and ideas about future directions for their work.

<strong>Research Papers</strong>: Papers in this category can describe completed work, or work-in-progress with preliminary results. For these papers, the first author **MUST BE** a current graduate or undergraduate student. We encourage submissions from Ph.D. students, as well as Masters or advanced undergraduate students. Topics of interest for the SRW are the same as EACL main conference <https://2021.eacl.org/calls/papers/>.

Please see the submission guidelines page for more information at <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/eaclsrw2021/submission-guidelines">https://sites.google.com/<wbr>view/<wbr>eaclsrw2021/<wbr>submission-guidelines</a>.

<strong>Pre-submission mentoring program</strong>: The goal is to improve the presentation of the student's work, not to critique the work itself. Mentors will provide feedback in the format of guidelines and suggestions to improve the overall writing. Participation is optional but encouraged.

You CAN submit a paper to the main deadline, even if you did not participate in pre-submission mentoring.

## Benefits of participation

- All accepted papers and thesis proposals will be presented in the main conference poster session, giving students an opportunity to interact with and present their work to a large and diverse audience, including top researchers in the field and assigned mentors.
- Submissions (in both categories) may either be archival or non-archival, based on the wishes of the authors. All archival papers will be published in the EACL 2021 SRW Proceedings. All non-archival papers may be submitted to any venue in the future except another SRW.
- Each participant is also assigned a mentor - an experienced researcher - who can provide valuable advice on the submission during the pre-submission period and mentoring during the conference.

## Studentships by  EACL

A limited number of EACL Studentships are available on a competitive basis, covering up to 500 euros of conference expenses (registration, travelling, accommodation). Preference will be given to students who have a paper accepted at the Student Workshop and with limited travel funds.

## Submission Requirements

We accept both archival submissions (i.e., the work can be included in the conference proceedings) and non-archival submissions (the work will be presented in the workshop, but will not be part of the proceedings).

The “archival” submissions should follow the anonymity period and restrictions of the main conference as appears in <https://2021.eacl.org/calls/papers/>.

All papers consist of up to five (5) pages of content, plus unlimited references. Upon acceptance, papers will be given six (6) content pages. Authors are encouraged to use this additional page to address reviewers’ comments in their final versions.

Paper submissions must use the official EACL 2021 style templates. All submissions must be in PDF format and must conform to the official style guidelines, which are contained in these template files. The review process is blind; hence, all submissions must be anonymized.

To submit your paper or proposal, please use the Softconf START conference management system at <a href="https://www.softconf.com/eacl2021/SRW/">https://www.softconf.com/<wbr>eacl2021/<wbr>SRW/</a>.
