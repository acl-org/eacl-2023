  Please direct questions about your registration, including alternate methods of payment, to Congrex service at [registration.eacl@congrex.com](mailto:registration.eacl@congrex.com).
  ​
  The EACL 2021 registration fees are reduced, reflecting our move to being 100% virtual. We are offering Early rates through April 7th and Late rates beginning April 8th. We include early and late rates to encourage early registrations so we can approximate the numbers of users and be able to work around any potential for system crashes or other glitches due to unexpected high volume. The fees charged will allow full access to all parts of the conference.

## ACL Membership

​
The ACL policy is that everyone attending an ACL conference must be a current (CY 2021) ACL member. So, in addition to the above registration fee, each Regular will add $100 membership fee to their registration and each Student will add $50 membership fee to their registration if not already a 2021 paid member. Your ACL membership is for the entire calendar year, providing membership in the society devoted to promoting CL research throughout the world, open access to the CL and TACL Journals and ACL Anthology as well as access to other ACL conferences in the same year without paying membership again. Membership also entitles you to electronic notification of new issues of the journals, discounts on publications from participating publishers, announcements of ACL and related conferences, workshops, and journal calls of interest to the community.
​

## Reduced Rate Memberships

​
The ACL offers a discount to members from developing countries. We hope this discount will allow for more people from these countries to become a part of the ACL and enjoy its benefits. To be able to benefit from reduced rate memberships, you need to become a member through the ACL portal. You can then register for the conference as a member.

## Ethics

Violations of the code of ethics as well as complaints raised under the anti-harassment policy should be brought to the [Professional Conduct Committee](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Professional_Conduct_Committee), who can be reached during the conference via the PCC channel in RocketChat, or you may also contact any current member of the [EACL Executive Board](http://eacl.org/general/#officers). Please be assured that if you approach the PCC or EACL board members, your concerns will be kept in strict confidence, and we will consult with you on any actions taken.
