  <h2 id="call-for-mentors-at-eacl-2021">Call for mentors at EACL 2021</h2>

  The EACL 2021 D&I committee would like to call for expressions of interest to host group mentoring sessions.

  As part of the NLP community’s initiatives to improve diversity and inclusion, EACL 2021 is organising group mentoring sessions to offer students and early career researchers the opportunity to interact with and get advice from senior researchers. These virtual sessions will be structured as roundtable discussion/Q&A sessions. We will be assigning you to a session and a discussion group that you will lead, using the information you provide here.

  Please fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSerFIYCSZbMXCdceEBq67XGlPVBLt3fZUZAOEsblEu9XAh70A/viewform) if you are interested in being a mentor at EACL 2021.<br/>
  Looking forward to your submissions!

  <h2 id="call-for-affinity-group-socials">Call for affinity group socials</h2>

  As part of the EACL 2021, we would like to call for expressions of interest to host affinity group socials.

  Affinity group socials are meant to serve the purpose of cohort and community building, and can both be fora for scientific and social exchange. The format of virtual affinity group socials has been successful in 2020, at ACL, EMNLP and COLING, where groups like [Queer in AI](https://sites.google.com/view/queer-in-ai/) and [Black in AI](https://blackinai.github.io/) organised events. Another example could be “Linguists at EACL”, “Professors in NLP”, or anything we missed that is not primarily technical.

  To express interest in organising an affinity group social, please fill in the following form by **24 March**: <https://forms.gle/7159FMuW7MbuZSxu5>

  <h2 id="nlp-applications-for-emergency-situations-and-crisis-management">NLP Applications for Emergency Situations and Crisis Management</h2>

  By: Robert Munro

  For the first time, a major NLP conference has a track on disaster response! The “NLP Applications for Emergency Situations and Crisis Management” track at EACL 2021 encourages researchers to share their work on a broad range of topics in disaster prevention, response, and recovery. As someone who has worked in both NLP and disaster response for many years, I am delighted to be the Senior Area Chair for this track and to be joined by Area Chairs, Antonios Anastasopoulos, Ishan Jindal, Rada Mihalcea, and Graham Neubig. We encourage papers that show innovation in NLP for disaster response while at the same time maintaining the privacy, safety, and dignity of crisis-affected populations. A broad-range of application areas are encouraged, including prevention, logistics support, and long-term disasters like climate change. For more on what makes a good paper, see my recent article: [Research on Machine Learning for Disaster Response: what makes a good paper](https://towardsdatascience.com/research-on-machine-learning-for-disaster-response-b65f3e97c018?source=friends_link&sk=e2e8e7ef66cae276bde29298b7516955)?

  <h2 id="location">Location</h2>

  EACL 2021 will now be held entirely online, rather than in Kyiv as previously announced, to avoid the need for international travel and risk of further spread of COVID-19. We will take steps to ensure there is as much virtual social interaction as possible. We will post further information here as it becomes available.
